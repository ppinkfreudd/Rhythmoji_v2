# Rhythmoji_v2 🎵🧩

Hello there! This project is a unique blend of music, AI, and creativity. It uses your Spotify data to generate a personalized Lego figure that reflects your music taste.

## How it Works 🛠️

Rhythmoji_v2 leverages the OpenAI API to create creative prompts based on your favorite genres and artists. These prompts are then fed into DALL-E, an AI model that generates images from textual descriptions. The result is a unique Lego figure that represents your music taste.

The project is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing the Spotify Web API to fetch user data. The front-end is a straightforward HTML/CSS/JavaScript setup.

## Features 🌟

- **Personalized Lego Figures**: Generate a unique Lego figure based on your music taste.
- **Weekly Releases**: New designs are released every week. Stay tuned for the latest trends.

## Privacy 🔒

Your privacy is important to us. Rhythmoji only uses your Spotify data to create your figure and doesn't store any personal information.

## Support 🤝

Rhythmoji is open-source and always looking for contributions. If you're interested in supporting us, consider starring our project on GitHub or contributing to the code.
